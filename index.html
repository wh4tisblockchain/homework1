		<p>As an <b>Instructional Technologist</b>, I provide technical expertise to faculty and other members of the Hofstra Community. One of my major responsibilities is supporting Blackboard Learn, our campuses learning management system. I offer basic to advanced technical support over the phone, via email, or in person for a varying range of users. In addition to user support, I also perform security reviews on all building block software. By reviewing the licenses, agreements, and soliciting answers to security questions from vendors, I can confirm if a building block is safe to install. I also assist faculty with course development, delivered via Blackboard for several online programs.</p>

		<p>As an <strong>educator</strong>, I teach classes to incoming graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in Information Technology. In addition to the technical skills, such as Excel, HTML, and database skills, my courses reflect the history and current state of Information Systems in business, as well as emerging and future trends.
